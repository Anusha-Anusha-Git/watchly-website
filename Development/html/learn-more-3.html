        The evolution of watch designs has been a fascinating journey, marked by technological advancements, changing fashion trends, and evolving consumer preferences. Here are the key milestones:

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Early 1900s: Pocket Watches</strong></li>
        <p>
          In the early 20th century, pocket watches were the trend. They featured intricate engravings, were often made of precious metals, and had a classic round shape. Pocket watches were primarily carried in a person's pocket, attached to a chain.

        <li><strong>1920s-1930s: Art Deco Influence</strong></li>
        <p>
          During this period, watches were influenced by the Art Deco movement. They became smaller and more streamlined, with geometric shapes and bold, symmetrical patterns. Rectangular and square cases gained popularity, and dial designs became more minimalist and sophisticated.

        <li><strong>1940s-1950s: World War II and Utility Watches</strong></li>
        <p>
          During World War II, wristwatches gained prominence due to their practicality in military operations. Utility watches, also known as “military watches,” were designed for legibility and durability. They typically had larger cases, luminous dials, and robust construction.
